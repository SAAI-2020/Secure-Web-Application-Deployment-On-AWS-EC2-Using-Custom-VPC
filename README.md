🔐 Secure-Web-Application-Deployment-On-AWS-EC2-Using-Custom-VPC

📌 Project Overview: 

Deployed a production style web application on AWS EC2 using a custom VPC, security best practices and monitering and demonstating real world cloud and networking skills.

🏗️ Architecture

The architecture includes:
- **Custom VPC** with public and private subnets  
- **Internet Gateway** for public subnet access  
- **NAT Gateway** for secure outbound traffic from private subnet  
- **Route Tables** for proper routing between subnets  
- **Security Groups & Network ACLs** for controlled access  
- **IAM Roles** for secure permissions management  
- **EC2 Instances** hosting the web application  
- **HTTPS/SSL** for encrypted communication

✨ Features includes:

- Secure deployment of web application in AWS cloud  
- Network segmentation using public and private subnets  
- Traffic management with route tables and NAT gateways  
- Access control using Security Groups, Network ACLs, and IAM roles  
- HTTPS/SSL encryption for secure communication  
- High availability and scalable design

🛠️ Tools & Technologies: 
- ☁️ Cloud Provider: AWS  
- 🔐 Services: EC2, VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, NAT Gateway, Security Groups, IAM  
- 🐧 Security: Network ACLs, HTTPS/SSL  
- 🌍 Other: Linux, Apache/Nginx (Web Server)

🚀 Setup Instructions:
1. **Create a Custom VPC** in AWS Management Console.  
2. **Create Public and Private Subnets** across different availability zones.  
3. **Set up Internet Gateway** and attach it to the VPC.  
4. **Configure NAT Gateway** in the public subnet.  
5. **Create Route Tables** and associate them with subnets for proper routing.  
6. **Launch EC2 Instances** in public/private subnets as required.  
7. **Configure Security Groups & Network ACLs** for access control.  
8. **Install Web Application** on EC2 instances (Apache/Nginx, application files).  
9. **Enable HTTPS/SSL** for secure communication.  
10. **Test Application** access from public internet and internal network.  

🎯 Project Outcomes:
- Demonstrated **secure cloud architecture** deployment.  
- Implemented **best practices for AWS networking and security**.  
- Gained hands-on experience in **EC2 management, VPC design, and cloud security**.
